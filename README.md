## Abstract
Why does the intuition of the "explanatory gap" persist despite physicalist explanations? This paper proposes a theoretical framework that redefines qualia as a **Socially Shared Tool**.
According to this theory, qualia are internal interfaces evolved under three structural conditions: (i) Necessity of multi-agent coordination, (ii) Irreversible compression of internal states, and (iii) Non-calibratability.
This framework explains the reality of qualia, their social origin, and the persistence of the explanatory gap intuition within a single structural model. Furthermore, it presents falsifiable predictions regarding the disappearance of qualia in fully shared environments.
